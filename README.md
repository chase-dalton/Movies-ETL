# Movies-ETL

## Overview
By using Python, I was able to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs transformations, and loads the data into a PostgreSQL database. With data gathered from Wikipedia, Kaggle, and MovieLens in the format of CSV and JSON files, I created an ETL Python function to read the data into Pandas DataFrames to be transformed. Using functions in Python and the Regular Expression (RE) library, the DataFrames were cleansed and merged into final DataFrames to then be imported into a PostgreSQL database.
